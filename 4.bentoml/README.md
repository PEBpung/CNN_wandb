## BentoML PyTorch MNIST Tutorial
Here is a tutorial on how to use BentoML to package a PyTorch model trained on the MNIST dataset, using the example code provided at the [bentoml repo]("https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/tree/main/examples/pytorch_mnist")


## **Prerequisites**

- Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Training the model**

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PEBpung/MLOps-Tutorial
cd MLOps-Tutorial/4.bentoml
```

1. Take a look at the **`train.py`** file. This file contains code for training a PyTorch machine learning model using the **`model.py`** file, as well as code for packaging the model with BentoML.
2. Run the following command to train and package the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“Œ View Train Result</summary>

```bash
Training using cpu.
Train Epoch: 0  Loss: 0.505
Train Epoch: 1  Loss: 0.225
Train Epoch: 2  Loss: 0.169
Test Result ACC: 0.956
Saved model: Model(tag="pytorch_mnist:gmkted4dgkuoyycf")
```
</details>

This will create a BentoML package containing the trained model and the necessary functions for serving it.

## **Serving the trained model**
Take a look at the service.py file. This file contains code for serving the BentoML package as a REST API using FastAPI.

Run the following command to start the model server:

```bash
bentoml serve service:svc
```

This will start the model server and listen for HTTP POST requests at the /predict endpoint. The input data should be provided in the request body, and the expected output format should be specified in the Content-Type header.
